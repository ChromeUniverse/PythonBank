# Python Bank, Inc.
A simple web banking simulator built with Python. Complete with a database, ledger, and activity logger.

### More about this program
User data (UserID, password, account balance) is stored in a simple plaintext database: `database.txt`.

Tranfers between users are recorded on `ledger.txt` with a timestamp.

All activity (logins, signouts, deposits, withdrawals, transfers) is logged in `log.txt` with a timestamp.
